# WriteAndRead_WS

A WebSocket-based project where one server writes data to a file and another reads from it in real-time.  
It demonstrates sending messages from a frontend to a backend server and reading updates live on another frontend.

## Features

- Server 1 receives messages from clients and writes them to `server_one_Data.txt`.
- Server 2 reads messages from the file and sends updates to connected clients.
- Real-time communication between two separate frontends using WebSockets.
- Read last N lines from the file, either from start or end.
